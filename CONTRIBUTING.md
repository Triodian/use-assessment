# Contributing to AI Use Assessment

Thank you for helping. AI Use Assessment is part of the Triodian AI governance apps and is open source under the
[Apache License, Version 2.0](LICENSE).

## Before you start

- For anything larger than a small fix, open an issue first so we can agree the approach.
- To report a security problem, do not open an issue: see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
- Please follow the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Making a change

1. Fork the repository and create a branch from `main`.
2. Make the change, with tests. Unit tests are in `tests/*.test.mjs`; browser tests are in `tests/e2e/specs/`. Run the browser tests if you change the app's screens.
3. Run the tests:
   ```
   for f in tests/*.test.mjs; do node "$f" || exit 1; done
   cd tests/e2e && npm ci && npx playwright install chromium && npx playwright test
   ```
4. Open a pull request against `main`, saying what changed and why. The tests run on every pull request.

## What we look for

- **Plain wording.** Text people read in the app is short and plain. Wording from the framework lives in the content file, not in code. Files under `lib/identity/` are shared by the four engagement apps and kept identical (`tools/sync-identity.mjs`); change them in all four.
- **No legal conclusions.** The app records facts and the positions people take. It never says what the law requires;
  that is for counsel.
- **No client data.** Never commit client names, personal information, documents or secrets, in code, tests or
  fixtures. Worked examples use fictional organisations.
- **Small, focused pull requests.** One change per pull request is easier to review.
